# My Licktionary - API 🎷

The RESTful backend for **My Licktionary**, a digital vocabulary manager for jazz musicians. This service manages the storage, retrieval, and categorization of musical phrases ("licks") using MongoDB.

## 📖 About

The goal of **My Licktionary** is to encourage the habit of transcription and provide a centralized home for musical ideas.

While jazz musicians often critique the rote memorization of licks as "painting by numbers," developing improvisers need a starting point. Just as one must learn words and phrases to speak a language fluently, a musician needs vocabulary to construct a solo. This tool serves as a personal dictionary—a launchpad to capture what you hear, internalize the language, and eventually evolve those ideas into your own unique voice.
